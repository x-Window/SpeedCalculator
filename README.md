To download:<br />

Windows: Download the Wyndcode-Speed-Calculator.exe<br />
Steps to use:<br />
There are 2 scenarios, one in which you take turn 1 and one in which you take turn 2. Mark the turn 2 box and enter the speed of your unit that is taking the turn, cr of the opponent's fastest unit, and whether or not you've been slowed.<br />
If turn 2 is marked when the battle is created, enemy units can be checked as units who have lapped you to calculate their speeds. <br />
There is an instructions button with information as well on the battle window.<br />
Once CRs are entered, names are set to preference, and speeds are calculated, the function on the right can check whether a certain unit will outspeed another unit at any time during the battle.<br /><br />

Purpose:<br />
For all the sweats of E7 to be able to control their matches more precisely.<br />
By taking a snapshot of the battle on turn 1, even when outsped or slowed, a player can calculate the speeds of all units to show to their guild or to check whether a unit will lap another.<br />
Int less in guild war and maybe arena too. Try doing this in rta if you're fluent enough with the inputs.<br /><br />
Issues:<br />
Not all scenarios are covered. The following are known:<br />
Speed buffed opener (Landy or Siseria in guild wars)<br />
CR pushed opener/units(can just subtract the CR)<br />
Revenge set units and BBK<br /><br />
What is this?:<br />
It is a Java swing GUI desktop application. I hope you can excuse its clunkiness.
